# Go Backend Platform

A production-style backend service written in Go that simulates wallet and transfer operations while demonstrating clean architecture, transactional safety, and asynchronous event processing.

This project focuses on backend system design, reliability, and infrastructure patterns rather than UI.

---

## Architecture Overview

API Service
- REST APIs using Gin
- PostgreSQL for core transactional data
- Redis for event queueing

Worker Service
- Consumes events from Redis
- Persists audit logs asynchronously
- Supports graceful shutdown

This demonstrates:
- Atomic database transactions
- Row-level locking for concurrency safety
- Event-driven architecture
- Eventual consistency pattern
- Background job processing

## Tech Stack

- Go
- Gin

- Atomic money transfers using DB transactions
- Row-level locking to prevent race conditions
- Redis-based async event queue
- Background worker service
- Audit logging via eventual consistency
- Health checks for DB and Redis
- Graceful shutdown handling
